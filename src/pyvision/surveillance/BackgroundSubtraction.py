    This class is useful for simple N-frame differencing method of
    background subtraction. If you have a stationary camera, this can
    be a simple and effective way to isolate people/moving objects
    from the background scene.
    
    FrameDifferencer uses ImageBuffer for operation. Assume the buffer
    size is 5. The output of the frame differencing operation will
    be based on the middle image, the 3rd in the buffer. The output
    is the intersection of the following two absolute differences:
    abs(Middle-First) AND abs(Last-Middle).
